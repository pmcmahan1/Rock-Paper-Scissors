# Rock-paper-scissors-V2
This was one of my first Odin Projects completed.

The styling on it is a bit weak, I was primarily focused on working out the javascript behind the game itself and making sure it ran properly.
I was considering replacing the buttons with images, however the script currently works with using the text content of the buttons itself to set the users choice, so I decided to leave that alone and may return to it another day.
